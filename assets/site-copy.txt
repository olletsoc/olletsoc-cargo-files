From a humble beginning of static text, images, and links, the web has grown into a rich platform teeming with interactive content and powerful applications. 

We began by thoroughly researching the history of the net making sure that the facts we presented were accurate and compelling to the developer community. We carefully selected the most exciting moments in webs history. We even analyzed the pixel density of screens and the method that early browsers used to load web pages.
